# PyRated - Plagiarism Detector
This project aims to develop a source code plagiarism detector using Python. It is a part of [Seasons of Code](https://wncc-iitb.org/soc/) programme conducted by [The Web and Coding Club, IIT Bombay](https://wncc-iitb.org/).

# How to run the code?
To run the code on the files that have been hardcoded into the main function - <br>
cd into the Final directory and run `python3 Multi_Layer_Comparison.py` <br>

To run the code on a different pair of code files, modify the file paths on the last line of Multi_Layer_Comparison.py and run the command mentioned above <br>

To find some sample files to test the code on, take a look at the Final/Dataset folder <br>

# The Results
The directory named "Final" contains the final codes files, and a few other files for testing and plotting test results. The sub-directory inside Final named "Results" has some screenshots of results obtained during various stages of testing.
